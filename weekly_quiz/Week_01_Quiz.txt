# 1. Download and install Anaconda 3 via https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual 
#    Follow the instructions here for your os: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

#     On windows via Start->Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3)

# 3. On the command line, in the (base) environment
#    create a new virtual environment using the requirements file:
$ conda create -n eods-f20 --file docs/requirements.txt

# 4. Activate the new environment
$ conda activate eods-f20

# 5. Add the new environment to jupyter
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name eods-f20

# 6. Return to the base environment and launch Jupyter Notebook server
$ conda deactivate
$ jupyter notebook

# 7. In Jupyter, navigate to the folder: weekly_quiz/

# 8. Open a new notebook using the newly created kernel 'eods-f20'
